# nyt-spelling-bee-totals

The NYT "Spelling Bee" puzzle doesn't tell you the maximum number of words. And it's not for want of email.

This program will tell you the maximum number of words for a given puzzle. You can also get the number of words by word length,
OR if the actual solution. Kind of. 

They don't use any official word list. They filter out 'obscure' words, but it's at the discretion of the puzzle maker.
The word list I'm using right now is definitely way too big, so it'll overcount the number of words in the NYT Solution. 
Gotta find a better one. Ideas/links welcome. 

Download/clone the repository. From the command line, run with 'python main.py' and follow instructions. But as an overview of the commands:

'total words' - get number of total words (not the words themselves.)
'word lengths' - get number of words by lengths. 
'show all' - get all the words. 

Again, way overcounted. I'll get a new wordlist though.
